# BlackJack-Game
This project is a command-line Blackjack game implemented in Python. It simulates a simplified version of the popular casino card game where the user plays against the computer (dealer). The game includes features such as card dealing, score calculation, handling of Aces (11 or 1), and win/lose conditions.
